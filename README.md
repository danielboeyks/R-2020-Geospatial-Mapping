# R-2020-Geospatial-Mapping

map.html makes use of existing datasets to explore the functionalities of R's geospatial data packages.
map_part2.html explores plotting NYC Open Data sets on ggmap.
map_part3.html combines NYC Open Data sets as well as Google's Static Maps API to create geospatial visualizations using Simple Features. Here, I attempt to combine data, calculate statistics of interest (e.g. density of incidents) and produce coloured maps.

Datasets here were taken from packages themselves as well as NYC Open Data.
